  <h3 style="color:white"> The international rules specify that the game is played with a sphere having a mass of 2.7 

grams (0.095 oz) and a diameter of 40 millimetres (1.57 in). The rules say that the ball shall 

bounce up 24–26 cm (9.4–10.2 in) when dropped from a height of 30.5 cm (12.0 in) onto a 

standard steel block thereby having a coefficient of restitution of 0.89 to 0.92. The ball is made 

of plastic as of 2015, colored white or orange, with a matte finish. The choice of ball color is 

made according to the table color and its surroundings. For example, a white ball is easier to 

see on a green or blue table than it is on a grey table. Manufacturers often indicate the quality 

of the ball with a star rating system, usually from one to three, three being the highest grade. 

As this system is not standard across manufacturers, the only way a ball may be used in official 

competition is upon ITTF approval (the ITTF approval can be seen printed on the ball).

The 40 mm ball was introduced after the 2000 Summer Olympics. However, this created some 

controversy at the time as the Chinese National Team argued that this was merely to give non-

Chinese players a better chance of winning since the new type of ball has a slower speed (a 40 

mm table tennis ball is slower and spins less than the original 38 mm one, and at that time, 

most Chinese players were playing with fast attack and smashes). China won all four Olympic 

gold medals and three silvers in 2000, and have continued to dominate</h3>

<h3 style="color:white">The table is 2.74 m (9.0 ft) long, 1.525 m (5.0 ft) wide, and 76 cm (2.5 ft) high with any 

continuous material so long as the table yields a uniform bounce of about 23 cm (9.1 in) when a 

standard ball is dropped onto it from a height of 30 cm (11.8 in), or about 77%.[23][24] The 

table or playing surface is uniformly dark coloured and matte, divided into two halves by a net 

at 15.25 cm (6.0 in) in height. The ITTF approves only wooden tables or their derivates. 

Concrete tables with a steel net or a solid concrete partition are sometimes available in outside 

public spaces, such as parks.</h3>

<h3 style="color:whites">Main article: Table tennis racket

Players are equipped with a laminated wooden racket covered with rubber on one or two sides 

depending on the grip of the player. The ITTF uses the term "racket", though "bat" is common 

in Britain, and "paddle" in the U.S.

The wooden portion of the racket, often referred to as the "blade", commonly features 

anywhere between one and seven plies of wood, though cork, glass fiber, carbon fiber, 

aluminum fiber, and Kevlar are sometimes used. According to the ITTF regulations, at least 85% 

of the blade by thickness shall be of natural wood. Common wood types include balsa, limba, 

and cypress or "hinoki," which is popular in Japan. The average size of the blade is about 17 

centimetres (6.7 in) long and 15 centimetres (5.9 in) wide. Although the official restrictions only 

focus on the flatness and rigidness of the blade itself, these dimensions are optimal for most 

play styles.

    Table tennis regulations allow different surfaces on each side of the racket. Various types of 

surfaces provide various levels of spin or speed, and in some cases they nullify spin. For 

example, a player may have a rubber that provides much spin on one side of his racket, and one 

that provides no spin on the other. By flipping the racket in play, different types of returns are 

possible. To help a player distinguish between the rubber used by his opposing player, 

international rules specify that one side must be red while the other side must be black. The 

player has the right to inspect his opponent's racket before a match to see the type of rubber 

used and what colour it is. Despite high speed play and rapid exchanges, a player can see clearly 

what side of the racket was used to hit the ball. Current rules state that, unless damaged in 

play, the racket cannot be exchanged for another racket at any time during a match.</h3>
