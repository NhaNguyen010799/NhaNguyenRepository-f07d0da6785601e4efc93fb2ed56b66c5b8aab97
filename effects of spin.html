        <h2>Adding spin onto the ball causes major changes in table tennis gameplay. Although 

nearly every stroke or serve creates some kind of spin, understanding the individual types of 

spin allows players to defend against and use different spins effectively</h2>

        <h3>Backspin</h3>

        <table table style="width:90%">

        <tr>

            <td><h3 style="color:#9AFEFF">Backspin is where the bottom half of the ball is rotating away from the player, and is 

imparted by striking the base of the ball with a downward movement.[51] At the professional 

level, backspin is usually used defensively in order to keep the ball low.[52] Backspin is 

commonly employed in service because it is harder to produce an offensive return, though at 

the professional level most people serve sidespin with either backspin or topspin. Due to the 

initial lift of the ball, there is a limit on how much speed with which one can hit the ball without 

missing the opponent's side of the table. However, backspin also makes it harder for the 

opponent to return the ball with great speed because of the required angular precision of the 

return. Alterations are frequently made to regulations regarding equipment in an effort to 

maintain a balance between defensive and offensive spin choices.[citation needed] It is actually 

possible to smash with backspin offensively, but only on high balls that are close to the 

                net.</h3></td>

        <h3>Topspin</h3>

        <table table style="width:100%">

        <tr>
            <td><h3 style="color:#9AFEFF">The topspin stroke has a smaller influence on the first part of the ball-curve. Like the 

backspin stroke, however, the axis of spin remains roughly perpendicular to the trajectory of 

the ball thus allowing for the Magnus effect to dictate the subsequent curvature. After the apex 

of the curve, the ball dips downwards as it approaches the opposing side, before bouncing. On 

the bounce, the topspin will accelerate the ball, much in the same way that a wheel which is 

already spinning would accelerate upon making contact with the ground. Again, the most 

significant change appears when the opponent attempts to return the ball (with a smooth, 

pimples inwards rubber). Due to the topspin, the ball jumps upwards and the opponent is 

forced to compensate for the topspin by adjusting the angle of his or her racket. This is 

commonly known as "closing the racket". The speed limitation of the topspin stroke is minor 

compared to the backspin stroke. This stroke is the predominant technique used in professional 

competition because it gives the opponent less time to respond. In table tennis topspin is 

regarded as an offensive technique due to increased ball speed, lower bio-mechanical efficiency 

and the pressure that it puts on the opponent by reducing reaction time. (It is possible to play 

defensive topspin-lobs from far behind the table, but only highly skilled players use this stroke 

with any tactical efficiency.) Topspin is the least common type of spin to be found in service at 

the professional level, simply because it is much easier to attack a top-spin ball that is not 

                moving at high speed.</h3></td>

            </table>

        <h3>Sidespin</h3>

        <h3 style="color:#9AFEFF"><p>

This type of spin is predominantly employed during service, wherein the contact angle of the 

racket can be more easily varied. Unlike the two aforementioned techniques, sidespin causes 

the ball to spin on an axis which is vertical, rather than horizontal. The axis of rotation is still 

roughly perpendicular to the trajectory of the ball. In this circumstance, the Magnus effect will 

still dictate the curvature of the ball to some degree. Another difference is that unlike backspin 

and topspin, sidespin will have relatively very little effect on the bounce of the ball, much in the 

same way that a spinning top would not travel left or right if its axis of rotation were exactly 

vertical. This makes sidespin a useful weapon in service, because it is less easily recognized 

when bouncing, and the ball "loses" less spin on the bounce. Sidespin can also be employed in 

offensive rally strokes, often from a greater distance, as an adjunct to topspin or backspin. This 

stroke is sometimes referred to as a "hook". The hook can even be used in some extreme cases 

to circumvent the net when away from the table. </p><

        <h3>Corkspin</h3>

<h3 style="color:#9AFEFF"><p>

        This type of spin is almost exclusively employed in service, but it is also used from time to 

time in the lob at the professional level. Unlike any of the aforementioned techniques, corkspin 

(sometimes referred to as "drill-spin") features a unique situation in which the axis of spin is 

more or less parallel to the trajectory of the ball. This means that the Magnus effect will have 

little to no effect on the trajectory of a cork-spun ball. Upon bouncing, the ball will dart right or 

left, depending on the direction of the spin, making it very difficult to return. Although in theory 

this type of spin produces the most obnoxious effects, it is not as strategically practical as 

sidespin or backspin in terms of the limitations that it imposes upon the opponent during their 

return. Aside from the initial direction change when bouncing, provided that it does not exceed 

the reach of the opponent, a cork-spun ball is easily countered with topspin or backspin. Similar 

to a backspin stroke, the corkspin stroke has a lower maximum velocity, simply due to the 

contact angle of the racket when producing the stroke. To impart a spin on the ball which is 

parallel to its trajectory, the racket must be swung more or less perpendicular to the trajectory 

of the ball. This greatly limits the amount of forward momentum that can be transferred to the 

ball by the racket. Corkspin is almost always mixed with another variety of spin, as it is less 

effective and harder to produce on its own.
