<h3>Though table tennis players grip their rackets in various ways, their grips can be classified 

into two major families of styles, penhold and shakehand. The rules of table tennis do not 

prescribe the manner in which one must grip the racket, and numerous grips are 

employed.</h3>

    <h2>Penhold</h2>

The penhold grip is so-named because one grips the racket similarly to the way one holds a 

writing instrument. The style of play among penhold players can vary greatly from player to 

player. The most popular style, usually referred to as the Chinese penhold style, involves curling 

the middle, ring, and fourth finger on the back of the blade with the three fingers always 

touching one another.[44] Chinese penholders favour a round racket head, for a more over-the-

table style of play. In contrast, another style, sometimes referred to as the Japanese/Korean 

penhold grip, involves splaying those three fingers out across the back of the racket, usually 

with all three fingers touching the back of the racket, rather than stacked upon one 

another.[44] Sometimes a combination of the two styles occurs, wherein the middle, ring and 

fourth fingers are straight, but still stacked, or where all fingers may be touching the back of the 

racket, but are also in contact with one another. Japanese/Korean penholders will often use a 

square-headed racket for an away-from-the-table style of play. Traditionally these square-

headed rackets feature a block of cork on top of the handle, as well as a thin layer of cork on 

the back of the racket, for increased grip and comfort. Penhold styles are popular among 

players originating from East Asian regions such as China, Taiwan, Japan, and South Korea.

Traditionally, penhold players use only one side of the racket to hit the ball during normal play, 

and the side which is in contact with the last three fingers is generally not used. This 

configuration is sometimes referred to as "traditional penhold" and is more commonly found in 

square-headed racket styles. However, the Chinese developed a technique in the 1990s in 

which a penholder uses both sides of the racket to hit the ball, where the player produces a 

backhand stroke (most often topspin) known as a reverse penhold backhand by turning the 

traditional side of the racket to face one's self, and striking the ball with the opposite side of the 

racket. This stroke has greatly improved and strengthened the penhold style both physically 

and psychologically, as it eliminates the strategic weakness of the traditional penhold 

backhand.

    <h2>Shakehand</h2>

The shakehand grip is so-named because the racket is grasped as if one is performing a 

handshake. Though it is sometimes referred to as the "tennis" or "Western" grip, it bears no 

relation to the Western tennis grip, which was popularized on the West Coast of the United 

States in which the racket is rotated 90°, and played with the wrist turned so that on impact the 

knuckles face the target. In table tennis, "Western" refers to Western nations, for this is the grip 

that players native to Europe and the Americas have almost exclusively employed.

        The shakehand grip’s simplicity and versatility, coupled with the acceptance among top-

level Chinese trainers that the European style of play should be emulated and trained against, 

has established it as a common grip even in China.[46] Many world class European and Asian 

players currently use the shakehand grip, and it is generally accepted that shakehands is easier 

to learn than penholder, allowing a broader range of playing styles both offensive and 

defensive.</p>

    <h2>Seemiller</h2>

The Seemiller grip is named after the American table tennis champion Danny Seemiller, who 

used it. It is achieved by placing your thumb and index finger on either side of the bottom of the 

racquet head and holding the handle with the rest of your fingers. Since only one side of the 

racquet is used to hit the ball, two contrasting rubber types can be applied to the blade, 

offering the advantage of "twiddling" the racket to fool the opponent. Seemiller paired inverted 

rubber with anti-spin rubber; many players today combine inverted and long-pipped rubber. 

The grip is considered exceptional for blocking, especially on the backhand side, and for 

forehand loops of backspin balls.[48] The Seemiller grip's popularity reached its apex in 1985 

when four (Danny Seemiller, Ricky Seemiller, Eric Boggan and Brian Masters) of the United 

States' five participants in the World Championships used it.
