    <h3>Offensive strokes</h3>

<h3>Hit</h3>

    A direct hit on the ball propelling it forward back to the opponent. This stroke differs from 

speed drives in other racket sports like tennis because the racket is primarily perpendicular to 

the direction of the stroke and most of the energy applied to the ball results in speed rather 

than spin, creating a shot that does not arc much, but is fast enough that it can be difficult to 

return. A speed drive is used mostly for keeping the ball in play, applying pressure on the 

opponent, and potentially opening up an opportunity for a more powerful attack.

    <h3>Loop</h3>

    Perfected during the 1960s, the loop is essentially the reverse of the speed drive. The racket 

is much more parallel to the direction of the stroke ("closed") and the racket thus grazes the 

ball, resulting in a large amount of topspin. A good loop drive will arc quite a bit, and once 

striking the opponent's side of the table will jump forward, much like a kick serve in tennis.

    Perfected during the 1960s,[4] the loop is essentially the reverse of the speed drive. The 

racket is much more parallel to the direction of the stroke ("closed") and the racket thus grazes 

the ball, resulting in a large amount of topspin. A good loop drive will arc quite a bit, and once 

striking the opponent's side of the table will jump forward, much like a kick serve in tennis.

   <h3>Counter-hit</h3>

The counter-hit is usually a counterattack against drives, normally high loop drives. The racket is 

held closed and near to the ball, which is hit with a short movement "off the bounce" 

(immediately after hitting the table) so that the ball travels faster to the other side. A well-

timed, accurate counter-drive can be as effective as a smash.

    <h3>Flick</h3>

When a player tries to attack a ball that has not bounced beyond the edge of the table, the 

player does not have the room to wind up in a backswing. The ball may still be attacked, 

however, and the resulting shot is called a flip because the backswing is compressed into a 

quick wrist action. A flip is not a single stroke and can resemble either a loop drive or a loop in 

its characteristics. What identifies the stroke is that the backswing is compressed into a short 

wrist flick.

    <h3>Smash</h3>

The offensive trump card is the smash. A player will typically execute a smash when his or her 

opponent has returned a ball that bounces too high or too close to the net. Smashing consists 

of using a large backswing and rapid acceleration to impart as much speed on the ball as 

possible. The goal of a smash is to get the ball to move so quickly that the opponent simply 

cannot return it. Because the ball speed is the main aim of this shot, often the spin on the ball is 

something other than topspin. Sidespin can be used effectively with a smash to alter the ball's 

trajectory significantly, although most intermediate players will smash the ball with little or no 

spin. An offensive table tennis player will think of a rally as a build-up to a winning smash.

    <h3>Defensive strokes</h3>

    <h3>Push</h3>

The push (or "slice" in Asia) is usually used for keeping the point alive and creating offensive 

opportunities. A push resembles a tennis slice: the racket cuts underneath the ball, imparting 

backspin and causing the ball to float slowly to the other side of the table. While not obvious, a 

push can be difficult to attack because the backspin on the ball causes it to drop toward the 

table upon striking the opponent's racket. In order to attack a push, a player must usually loop 

the ball back over the net. Often, the best option for beginners is to simply push the ball back 

again, resulting in pushing rallies. Against good players, it may be the worst option because the 

opponent will counter with a loop, putting the first player in a defensive position. Another 

response to pushing is flipping the ball when it is close to the net. Pushing can have advantages 

in some circumstances, such as when the opponent makes easy mistakes.

    <h3>Chop</h3>

A chop is the defensive, backspin counterpart to the offensive loop drive.[49] A chop is 

essentially a bigger, heavier push, taken well back from the table. The racket face points 

primarily horizontally, perhaps a little bit upward, and the direction of the stroke is straight 

down. The object of a defensive chop is to match the topspin of the opponent's shot with 

backspin. A good chop will float nearly horizontally back to the table, in some cases having so 

much backspin that the ball actually rises. Such a chop can be extremely difficult to return due 

to its enormous amount of backspin. Some defensive players can also impart no-spin or 

sidespin variations of the chop.

    <h3>Block</h3>

The block is a simple shot, but nonetheless can be devastating against an attacking opponent. A 

block is executed by simply placing the racket in front of the ball right after the ball bounces; 

thus, the ball rebounds back toward the opponent with nearly as much energy as it came in 

with. This is not as easy as it sounds, because the ball's spin, speed, and location all influence 

the correct angle of a block. It is very possible for an opponent to execute a perfect loop, drive, 

or smash, only to have the blocked shot come back at him just as fast. Due to the power 

involved in offensive strokes, often an opponent simply cannot recover quickly enough, and will 

be unable to return the blocked shot. Blocks almost always produce the same spin as was 

received, many times topspin. Depending on the spin of the ball, the block may be returned to 

an unexpected side of the table. This may come to your advantage, as the opponent may not 

expect this.

    <h3>Lob</h3>

The defensive lob is possibly the most impressive shot, since it propels the ball about five 

metres in height, only to land on the opponent's side of the table with great amounts of 

spin.[50] To execute, a defensive player first backs-off the table 4â€“6 meters; then, the stroke 

itself consists of lifting the ball to an enormous height before it falls back to the opponent's side 

of the table. A lob is inherently a creative shot, and can have nearly any kind of spin. Top-

quality players use this to their advantage in order to control the spin of the ball. For instance, 

though the opponent may smash the ball hard and fast, a good defensive lob could be more 

difficult to return due to the unpredictability and heavy amounts of the spin on the ball.[50] 

Thus, though backed off the table by tens of feet and running to reach the ball, a good 

defensive player can still win the point using good lobs. However, at the professional level, 

lobbers will lose the point most of the time, so the lob is not used unless it is really necessary.
