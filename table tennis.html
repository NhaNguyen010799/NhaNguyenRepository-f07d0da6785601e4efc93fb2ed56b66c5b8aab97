    Table tennis, also known as ping pong, is a sport in which two or four players hit a lightweight 

ball back and forth across a table using a small paddle. The game takes place on a hard table 

divided by a net. Except for the initial serve, the rules are generally as follows: Players must 

allow a ball played toward them to bounce one time on their side of the table, and must return 

it so that it bounces on the opposite side at least once. Points are scored when a player fails to 

return the ball within the rules. Play is fast and demands quick reactions. Spinning the ball 

alters its trajectory and limits an opponent's options, giving the hitter a great advantage. When 

doing so the hitter has a better chance of scoring if the spin is successful.

Table tennis is governed by the worldwide organization International Table Tennis Federation, 

founded in 1926. ITTF currently includes 220 member associations.[1] The table tennis official 

rules are specified in the ITTF handbook.[2] Table tennis has been an Olympic sport since 

1988,[3] with several event categories. In particular, from 1988 until 2004, these were: men's 

singles, women's singles, men's doubles and women's doubles. Since 2008, a team event has 

        been played instead of the doubles.</h2>
