    <h3> The sport originated in Victorian England, where it was played among the upper-class as 

an after-dinner parlour game.[4][5] It had several different names, including 'whiff-whaff', and 

it has been suggested that makeshift versions of the game were developed by British military 

officers in India or South Africa, who brought it back with them.[6] A row of books stood up 

along the center of the table as a net, two more books served as rackets and were used to 

continuously hit a golf-ball.[7][8] The name "ping-pong" was in wide use before British 

manufacturer J. Jaques & Son Ltd trademarked it in 1901. The name "ping-pong" then came to 

describe the game played using the rather expensive Jaques's equipment, with other 

manufacturers calling it table tennis. A similar situation arose in the United States, where 

Jaques sold the rights to the "ping-pong" name to Parker Brothers. Parker Brothers then 

enforced their trademark for the term in the 1920s making the various associations change 

their names to "table tennis" instead of the more common, but trademarked, term.[9]

The next major innovation was by James W. Gibb, a British enthusiast of table tennis, who 

discovered novelty celluloid balls on a trip to the US in 1901 and found them to be ideal for the 

game. This was followed by E.C. Goode who, in 1901, invented the modern version of the 

racket by fixing a sheet of pimpled, or stippled, rubber to the wooden blade. Table tennis was 

growing in popularity by 1901 to the extent that tournaments were being organized, books 

being written on the subject,[7] and an unofficial world championship was held in 1902.

In 1921, the Table Tennis Association was founded in Britain, and the International Table Tennis 

Federation (ITTF) followed in 1926.[4][10] London hosted the first official World Championships 

in 1926. In 1933, the United States Table Tennis Association, now called USA Table Tennis, was 

formed.[4][11]

In the 1930s, Edgar Snow commented in Red Star Over China that the Communist forces in the 

Chinese Civil War had a "passion for the English game of table tennis" which he found 

"bizarre".[12] On the other hand, popularity of the sport waned in 1930s Soviet Union, partly 

because of promotion of team and military sports, and partly because of a theory that the game 

had adverse health effects.[13]

    In the 1950s, paddles that used a rubber sheet combined with an underlying sponge layer 

changed the game dramatically,[4] introducing greater spin and speed.[14] These were 

introduced to Britain by sports goods manufacturer S.W. Hancock Ltd. The use of speed glue 

increased the spin and speed even further, resulting in changes to the equipment to "slow the 

game down". Table tennis was introduced as an Olympic sport at the Olympics in 1988.[15]

    <h1>Rule changes</h1>

    <h3>After the 2000 Olympics in Sydney, the ITTF instituted several rule changes that were 

aimed at making table tennis more viable as a televised spectator sport.[16][17] First, the older 

38 mm (1.50 in) balls were officially replaced by 40 mm (1.57 in) balls in October 2000.[7][18] 

This increased the ball's air resistance and effectively slowed down the game. By that time, 

players had begun increasing the thickness of the fast sponge layer on their paddles, which 

made the game excessively fast and difficult to watch on television. A few months later, the 

ITTF changed from a 21-point to an 11-point scoring system (and the serve rotation was 

reduced from five points to two), effective in September 2001.[7] This was intended to make 

games more fast-paced and exciting. The ITTF also changed the rules on service to prevent a 

player from hiding the ball during service, in order to increase the average length of rallies and 

to reduce the server's advantage, effective in 2002.[19] For the opponent to have time to 

realize a serve is taking place, the ball must be tossed a minimum of 16 cm in the air. The ITTF 

states that all events after July 2014 are played with a new poly material ball</h3>
