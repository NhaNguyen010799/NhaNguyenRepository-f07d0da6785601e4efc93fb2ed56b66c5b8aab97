<h2>Starting a game</h2>

According to ITTF rule 2.13.1, the first service is decided by lot, normally a coin toss. It is also 

common for one player (or the umpire/scorer) to hide the ball in one or the other hand, usually 

hidden under the table, allowing the other player to guess which hand the ball is in. The correct 

or incorrect guess gives the "winner" the option to choose to serve, receive, or to choose which 

side of the table to use. (A common but non-sanctioned method is for the players to play the 

ball back and forth three times and then play out the point. This is commonly referred to as 

"serve to play", "rally to serve", "play for serve", or "volley for serve".

<h2>Service and return</h2>

In game play, the player serving the ball commences a play. The server first stands with the ball 

held on the open palm of the hand not carrying the paddle, called the freehand, and tosses the 

ball directly upward without spin, at least 16 cm (6.3 in) high. The server strikes the ball with 

the racket on the ball's descent so that it touches first his court and then touches directly the 

receiver's court without touching the net assembly. In casual games, many players do not toss 

the ball upward; however, this is technically illegal and can give the serving player an unfair 

advantage.

The ball must remain behind the endline and above the upper surface of the table, known as 

the playing surface, at all times during the service. The server cannot use his/her body or 

clothing to obstruct sight of the ball; the opponent and the umpire must have a clear view of 

the ball at all times. If the umpire is doubtful of the legality of a service they may first interrupt 

play and give a warning to the server. If the serve is a clear failure or is doubted again by the 

umpire after the warning, the receiver scores a point.

If the service is "good", then the receiver must make a "good" return by hitting the ball back 

before it bounces a second time on receiver's side of the table so that the ball passes the net 

and touches the opponent's court, either directly or after touching the net assembly. 

Thereafter, the server and receiver must alternately make a return until the rally is over. 

Returning the serve is one of the most difficult parts of the game, as the server's first move is 

often the least predictable and thus most advantageous shot due to the numerous spin and 

speed choices at his or her disposal.

<h2>Let</h2>

A Let is a rally of which the result is not scored, and is called in the following circumstances:

The ball touches the net in service (service), provided the service is otherwise correct or the ball 

is obstructed by the player on the receiving side. Obstruction means a player touches the ball 

when it is above or traveling towards the playing surface, not having touched the player's court 

since last being struck by the player.

When the player on the receiving side is not ready and the service is delivered.

Player's failure to make a service or a return or to comply with the Laws is due to a disturbance 

outside the control of the player.

Play is interrupted by the umpire or assistant umpire.

A let is also called if the ball hits the server's side of the table if the ball does not pass further 

than the edge. If the ball hits the table edge and hits the net, it is called a foul serve.

<h2>Scoring</h2>

A point is scored by the player for any of several results of the rally:

The opponent fails to make a correct service or return.

After making a service or a return, the ball touches anything other than the net assembly 

before being struck by the opponent.

The ball passes over the player's court or beyond his end line without touching his court, after 

being struck by the opponent.

The opponent obstructs the ball.

The opponent strikes the ball twice successively. Note that the hand that is holding the racket 

counts as part of the racket and that making a good return off one's hand or fingers is allowed. 

It is not a fault if the ball accidentally hits one's hand or fingers and then subsequently hits the 

racket.

The opponent strikes the ball with a side of the racket blade whose surface is not covered with 

rubber.

The opponent moves the playing surface or touches the net assembly.

The opponent's free hand touches the playing surface.

As a receiver under the expedite system, completing 13 returns in a rally.

The opponent that has been warned by the umpire commits a second offense in the same 

individual match or team match. If the third offence happens, 2 points will be given to the 

player. If the individual match or the team match has not ended, any unused penalty points can 

be transferred to the next game of that match.

A game shall be won by the player first scoring 11 points unless both players score 10 points, 

when the game shall be won by the first player subsequently gaining a lead of 2 points. A match 

shall consist of the best of any odd number of games. In competition play, matches are typically 

best of five or seven games.

<h2>Alternation of services and ends</h2>

Service alternates between opponents every two points (regardless of winner of the rally) until 

the end of the game, unless both players score ten points or the expedite system is operated, 

when the sequences of serving and receiving stay the same but each player serves for only one 

point in turn (Deuce). The player serving first in a game receives first in the next game of the 

match.

After each game, players switch sides of the table. In the last possible game of a match, for 

example the seventh game in a best of seven matches, players change ends when the first 

player scores five points, regardless of whose turn it is to serve. Service is subject to change on 

game point of the match. Upon the possible last point of the match, the player with the lessor 

score serves. If the sequence of serving and receiving is out of turn or the ends are not changed, 

points scored in the wrong situation are still calculated and the game shall be resumed with the 

order at the score that has been reached.

<h2>Double game</h2>

Service zone in doubles game

In addition to games between individual players, pairs may also play table tennis. Singles and 

doubles are both played in international competition, including the Olympic Games since 1988 

and the Commonwealth Games since 2002. In 2005, the ITTF announced that doubles table 

tennis only was featured as a part of team events in the 2008 Olympics.

In doubles, all the rules of single play are applied except for the following.

<h3>Service</h3>

A line painted along the long axis of the table to create doubles courts bisects the table. This 

line's only purpose is to facilitate the doubles service rule, which is that service must originate 

from the right hand "box" in such a way that the first bounce of the serve bounces once in said 

right hand box and then must bounce at least once in the opponent side's right hand box (far 

left box for server), or the receiving pair score a point.

<h3>Order of play, serving and receiving</h3>

Players must hit the ball. For example, if A is paired with B, X is paired with Y, A is the server and 

X or Y is the receiver. The order of play shall be A→X or Y & B→X or Y & vice versa. The rally 

proceeds this way until one side fails to make a legal return and the other side scores.[42]

At each change of service, the previous receiver shall become the server and the partner of the 

previous server shall become the receiver. For example, if the previous order of play is A→X or 

Y & B→X or Y, the order becomes X→B or A & Y→B or A or X→B or A & Y→A or B after the 

change of service.[40]

In the second or the latter games of a match, the game begins in reverse order of play. For 

example, if the order of play is A→X or Y & B→Y or X at beginning of the first game, the order 

begins with X→A or B & Y→A & B in the second game depending on either X or Y being chosen 

as the first server of the game. That means the first receiver of the game is the player who 

served to the first server of the game in the preceding game. In each game of a doubles match, 

the pair having the right to serve first shall choose which of them will do so. The receiving pair, 

however, can only choose in the first game of the match.

When a pair reaches 5 points in the final game, the pairs must switch ends of the table and 

change the receiver to reverse the order of play. For example, when the last order of play 

before a pair score 5 points in the final game is A→X→B→Y, the order after change shall be 

A→Y→B→X if A still has the second serve. Otherwise, X is the next server and the order 

becomes X→A→Y→B.

Expedite system[edit]

If a game is unfinished after 10 minutes' play and fewer than 18 points have been scored, the 

expedite system is initiated.[37] The umpire interrupts the game, and the game resumes with 

players serving for one point in turn. If the expedite system is introduced while the ball is not in 

play, the previous receiver shall serve first. Under the expedite system, the server must win the 

point before the opponent makes 13 consecutive returns or the point goes to the opponent. 

The system can also be initiated at any time at the request of both players or pairs. Once 

introduced, the expedite system remains in force until the end of the match. A rule to shorten 

the time of a match, it is mainly seen in defensive players' games.
