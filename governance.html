    <h3 style="color:yellow">Founded in 1926, the International Table Tennis Federation (ITTF) is the worldwide 

governing body for table tennis, which maintains an international ranking system in addition to 

organizing events like the World Table Tennis Championships.[11] In 2007, the governance for 

table tennis for persons with a disability was transferred from the International Paralympic 

Committee to the ITTF.[67]

On many continents, there is a governing body responsible for table tennis on that continent. 

For example, the European Table Tennis Union (ETTU) is the governing body responsible for 

table tennis in Europe.[68] There are also national bodies and other local authorities 

responsible for the sport, such as USA Table Tennis (USATT), which is the national governing 

body for table tennis in the United States.</h3>
